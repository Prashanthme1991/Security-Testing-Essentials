An SQL backend is attached to an Internet facing web server, an attacker may be able to gain access to the internal network through SQL injection if the application is unsecure. 
SQL Injection – This is a technique by which attackers will use code, which includes SQL commands, to manipulate a web front end into revealing database information.
Hackers can exploit weaknesses in computer systems when vulnerabilities exist. An individual responsible for the network security of a company will need to patch systems that have vulnerabilities. It is also a best practice for a network administrator to shut down any unnecessary services that are running on their systems. If systems are not maintained or properly secured, hackers can take advantage of them. After a hacker breaks into a remote system, they will take steps to entrench themselves by creating accounts, stealing credentials, and exfiltrating data from the network
